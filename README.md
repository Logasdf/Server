## Server
This is a program operating as the main server for our another project.  
We are using C++ as the primary language and Visual Studio as IDE.

## Things to be done
- ~~Self-Study on IOCP and various concepts related to it.~~  
    - ~~Async IO~~  
    - ~~Non-Blocking IO~~  
    - ~~How to create an IO completion port and register a socket to it.~~
- ~~Write Server Sample Code~~
- ~~Write codes for accepting connection requests from clients.~~
- ~~**Self-Study on Object Serialization in C++**~~
    ~~- Create a data format for the better communication between the server and the client.~~
    ~~- Store client information ( ip addr etc. )~~
    ~~- Use "Protocol Buffer" for communication between the server(C++) and client(C#)~~
- Manage a list of gamerooms.  
    - Send that list to a client  
        - Only when asked ( like a client clicks "Refresh" button )
    - Make the necessary classes.
